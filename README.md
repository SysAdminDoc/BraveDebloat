## ‚ùì Why Debloat Brave?

Brave is a privacy-respecting browser, but it still includes optional features like crypto rewards, wallet integration, AI assistants, and sponsored content. If you want a faster, cleaner, and less distracting experience, this script helps streamline Brave into a lightweight, no-nonsense browser.
